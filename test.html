                <h2> Hardware vs Software</h2>
                <p>
                    Before we talk about different types of computers, let's talk about two things all computers have in common:
                    <I>hardware and software</I>.
                    <br>
                    <B> Hardware</B> is any part of your computer that has a physical structure, such as the keyboard or mouse. It also includes all of the computer's internal parts.<br>
                    <B>Software</B> is any set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do and how to do it. Examples of software include web browsers, games, and word processors.

                    When most people hear the word computer, they think of a personal computer such as a desktop or laptop. However, computers come in many shapes and sizes, and they perform many different functions in our daily lives. When you withdraw cash from an ATM,
                    scan groceries at the store, or use a calculator, you're using a type of computer.<br> Many people use
                    <B>desktop</B> computers at work, home, and school. Desktop computers are designed to be placed on a desk, and they're typically made up of a few different parts, including the computer case, monitor, keyboard, and mouse.<br> The second type of

                    <B>Tablet computers—or tablets  </B> are handheld computers that are even more portable than laptops. Instead of a keyboard and mouse, tablets use a touch-sensitive screen for typing and navigation. The iPad is an example of a tablet.<br>
